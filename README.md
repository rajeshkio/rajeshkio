# Hey, I'm Rajesh ðŸ‘‹

DevOps Engineer who likes to automate stuff so I can sleep better at night.

Been working with servers, containers, and cloud things for a while now. My job is making sure apps don't crash when everyone's trying to use them at the same time.

## What keeps me busy

I work with Kubernetes a lot. Also write Terraform configs and set up CI/CD pipelines. When something breaks at 2 AM, I'm usually the one fixing it.

Most of my day involves:
- Making deployment processes that don't need manual steps
- Setting up monitoring so we know when things go wrong
- Writing automation scripts in Python and Go
- Managing AWS and GCP infrastructure
- Helping developers deploy their code without breaking production

## Stuff I've written about

I write about problems I've solved. Maybe it'll help someone else who's stuck with the same issue.

## Tools I use

**Container stuff**: Docker for packaging apps, Kubernetes for running them. ArgoCD handles deployments through Git.

**Infrastructure**: Terraform for cloud resources, Ansible when I need to configure servers. Pulumi when I want to write infrastructure in actual programming languages.

**Monitoring**: Prometheus collects metrics, Grafana makes pretty charts. They tell me when things are about to break.

**Cloud**: AWS mostly, some GCP. DigitalOcean for personal projects because it's simple.

**Languages**: Go for backend services, Python for scripts and automation. Bash when I need something quick and dirty.
